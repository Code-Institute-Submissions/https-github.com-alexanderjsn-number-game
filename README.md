The number game is a game with a simple rule. Press the button to roll a random number from 1-6 and if your number is higher than the opponents, you score one point. Whoever scores 10 points first wins the game. 

## User Experience (UX)

### First Time Visitor Goals

1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the game mechanics and rules. 

2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to use all the games functions without any technical errors caused by bugs. 

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
    The website uses an indigo blue as a background colour and a white colour for the font. Upon hovering on the buttons or reset options, the text changes colour to a green/blue colour. 

#### Typography
    The main font is Roboto with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of technical errors. 

## Features

        - Responsive on all device sizes
        
        - Interactive elements

        - A reset button that gives the user the option to reset the game. 

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

    1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Used for importing the Roboto font. 

    2. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - Used to store the project and code.

    3  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Used to commit and push the code to Github.

## Testing

WIP

### Further Testing
-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

### Known Bugs

- Sometimes the site appears smaller on Google Chrome browser. Media queries has no effect on this issue and it has only been reported once by one user.
